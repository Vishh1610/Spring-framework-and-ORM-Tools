# Spring-framework-and-ORM-Tools

- This repository contains a small Spring Framework project that demonstrates the use of Hibernate JPA, Spring Boot, and JDBC. These technologies are commonly used together to build scalable, enterprise-level web applications.

- The project includes examples of data access and controller mappings using Spring annotations. These examples provide a good starting point for developers who are new to the Spring Framework and want to learn how to use these technologies in their own projects.

# Dependencies
 - This project requires the following dependencies:

- Spring Boot 
 - Hibernate JPA 
 - Spring JDBC 
 These dependencies are included in the pom.xml file and will be automatically downloaded by Maven.



# Examples

- The examples in this project demonstrate various features of the Spring Framework, including:

- Data access: These examples show how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Hibernate JPA and JDBC.
- Transaction management: These examples show how to use Spring's transaction management capabilities to ensure that multiple database operations are performed atomically.
- Controller mappings: These examples show how to use Spring annotations to map controller methods to HTTP requests.
  By studying these examples, developers can gain a better understanding of how to use these technologies in their own projects.
  
  I hope this project will help to many beginers as well as developer who wants quick look to the spring framework and it's module!
